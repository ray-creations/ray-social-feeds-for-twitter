Display clean, beautiful, customizable, responsive, yet powerful twitter feed on your website from any Twitter account or hashtags.

== Description ==
**Ray Social Feeds For Twitter** lets you display Twitter feeds beautifully on your website from any user timeline or hashtags. The feed is customizable and can be displayed anywhere on your site in a list format, using either shortcode or widget. 

You can **define defaults** on your Settings page. And can override those settings by specifying custom attributes in your shortcodes. Every widget can also have its own different settings.

Any page can have **multiple shortcodes and widgets**. And each can have its own custom specific settings. So each shortcode or widget can fetch different feeds from different Twitter accounts and hashtags.

The generated feeds are **mobile-friendly & responsive** and adapts to the width of the container in which the shortcode or widget is placed. Also, it automatically adapts the styling of your website.

The **Tweets are cached** for lightning-fast display. Specify your own cache duration.

Super easy to set up and install. **Generate your access tokens in a couple of clicks only**.


== Some highlights of the plugin ==

*   Generate your access tokens in a few clicks and start displaying feeds straight away.

*   Use the shortcode **[my_custom_tweets]** anywhere in your content area. Or use our customizable "widget" to display Twitter feeds in your site's sidebars & footers.

*   Use any Twitter "screen name" or "hashtags" to create your feeds.

*   When specifying **multiple hashtags**, simply separate them using space. No need to use the hash "#" or "@" symbol with your hashtags or with Twitter screen names.

*   **Multiple shortcodes & widgets** can be used on a single page or on different site pages.

*   You can define "default options" for the feed display using our plugin settings page.

*   The default options can be overridden by attributes you specify in your shortcodes. For example, if the default screen name is **raycreations**, and in your shortcode, you specify **[my_custom_tweets screen_name='rayamrit']**. Then the shortcode attribute screen_name takes precedence.

*   There is **no limit** to the number of instances of shortcodes or widgets you can place on any page or site.

*   The display is completely **Responsive** and adjusts to the width of the container in which the shortcode or widget is placed.

*   Displays perfectly on all screen sizes and devices.

*   Each individual feed generated by shortcodes and widgets are cached for lightning-fast display.

*   You can control the cache duration from our plugin settings page. The minimum duration is 1 hour. You can set the maximum cache duration to your liking.

*   Dedicated button to delete tweet feeds cache.

*   Also, whenever you save the plugin settings page, the tweets cache is automatically cleared to reflect the changes made. And new Tweets are fetched from Twitter again.

*   Adopts the styling from your website itself so that it looks & feels like a part of your site without you having to make any style changes in the CSS stylesheet.

*   Our Twitter plugin **supports extended tweets** and fetches the complete tweet from Twitter.

*   Include or exclude **Replies** from your Twitter feed.

*   Include or exclude **Retweets** from your Twitter feed.
