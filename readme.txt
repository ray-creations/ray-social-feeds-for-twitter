Display clean, beautiful, highly customizable, responsive, yet powerful twitter feeds on your website from any Twitter account or your own Mentions timeline.

== Description ==
**Ray Social Feeds For Twitter** lets you display Twitter feeds beautifully on your website. You can display your own mentions timeline or tweets from any Twitter user. The feed is highly customizable and can be displayed anywhere on your site in a **List** or **Slider** format, using either shortcode or widget. 

You can **define defaults** on your Settings page. And can override those settings by specifying custom attributes in your shortcodes. Every widget & shortcode can also have its own unique settings.

Any page can have **multiple shortcodes and widgets**. And each can have its own custom specific settings. So each shortcode or widget can fetch unique feeds.

The generated feeds are **mobile-friendly & responsive** and adapts to the width of the container in which they are placed. Also, it automatically adapts the styling of your website.

You get a "Styling tab" to control the look of the different components of the Twitter feed. You can change font size, color, font weight, inherit from theme. Tweet header, the tweet itself, and the Tweet footer can have separate styling.

You get a "Show/Hide" tab to hide or display the Tweet components you want. You can choose to hide or display almost all of the components that make up your feed.

You can control many aspects of the slider, like display Nav arrows, display Dot navigation, autoplay, transition interval, transition speed, pause on hover, loop, and auto height.

The **Tweets are cached** for lightning-fast display. Specify your own cache duration.

Super easy to set up and install. **Generate your access tokens in a couple of clicks only**.


== Some highlights of the plugin ==

*   Generate your access tokens in a few clicks and start displaying feeds straight away.

*   Use the shortcode **[my_custom_tweets]** anywhere in your content area. Or use our customizable "widget" to display Twitter feeds in your site's sidebars & footers.

*   Display your **Mentions** timeline. Or use any Twitter "screen name" to create your feeds.

*   **Multiple shortcodes & widgets** can be used on a single page or on different site pages.

*   You can define "default options" for the feed display using our plugin settings page.

*   The default options can be overridden by attributes you specify in your shortcodes. For example, if the default screen name is **raycreations**, and in your shortcode, you specify **[my_custom_tweets screen_name='rayamrit']**. Then the shortcode attribute screen_name takes precedence.

*   There is **no limit** to the number of instances of shortcodes or widgets you can place on any page or site.

*   The display is completely **Responsive** and adjusts to the width of the container in which the shortcode or widget is placed.

*   Displays perfectly on all screen sizes and devices.

*   Each individual feed generated by shortcodes and widgets are cached for lightning-fast display.

*   You can control the cache duration from our plugin settings page.

*   Dedicated button to delete tweet feeds cache.

*   Also, whenever you save the plugin settings page, the tweets cache is automatically cleared to reflect the changes made. And new tweets are fetched from Twitter again.

*   Dedicated Styling tab to control the looks of different Tweet components.

*   Our Twitter plugin **supports extended tweets** and fetches the complete tweet from Twitter.

*   Include or exclude **Replies** from your Twitter feed.

*   Include or exclude **Retweets** from your Twitter feed.

*   Add "nofollow" attributes to all external links in your tweets.
